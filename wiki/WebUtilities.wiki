_*WebUtilities* is a library of Java classes implemented as J2EE web components (Servlets, Filters, Tags etc.) to speed up the front-end of a web application on the fly._

Tools such as [http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/ YSlow] or [http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/ Page Speed] can be used to measure the client side performance. To improve the performance you have to apply the best practices [http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html suggested by these tools]. *WebUtilities* provides inbuilt components to apply following best practices in your web application.  

== Features ==

 * Serve multiple JS or CSS files in one request
 * Add Expires header for JS, CSS and Image files to be cached by browser
 * Minify JS, CSS files on the fly
 * Minify Inline CSS and JS code blocks
 * Add Character Encoding to your response
 * Server compressed contents (gzip/compress/deflate)

Let's see how to apply those best practices in your application and speed it up :)

==Get started==

To get started you will need to add latest *[http://code.google.com/p/webutilities/downloads/list webutilities-x.y.z.jar]* and *[http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/#yuicompressor yuicompressor-x.y.z.jar]* to your J2EE web project (by putting in WEB-INF/lib folder of your webapp). *WebUtilities* uses [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ YUICompressor] to minify JavaScript and CSS files on the fly.
